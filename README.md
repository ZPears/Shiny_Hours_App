# Shiny_Hours_App

This app was made for Greenough, a marketing agency in Boston.

Users can upload a .csv exported from TrackMyHours.com, as well as the standard .xlsx file Greenough uses to make staffing projections.

The app reads both files and creates a dashboard that shows progress against the projections.

Users can view the data by either staff member or client.

TBI:

The app will alert users when a staff member or client has exceeded projections.

The app will allow users to download an .xlsx that combines the projected hours and actual hours.

The app will format the downloaded .xlsx file to some degree (TBD, depending on capabilities of openxlsx R package).
